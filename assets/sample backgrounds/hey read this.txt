nice. way to be.

so layer0 is
1334 + 1334 + 1334 wide, aka 4002

the middle 1334 is the dimensions the player will see in the EXACT middle of the level


layer1 is 
1334 + 1334 + 1334 + 1334 + 1334, aka 6670

the middle 1334 is what the player will see for this layer in the EXACT middle of the level


layer2 is
poop
i mean
1334 + 1334, aka 2668
There is no middle, but this layer ACTUALLY LOOPS.
